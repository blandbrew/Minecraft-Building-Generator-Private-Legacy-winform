# Minecraft Building Generator for Bedrock
(This will work for Java but I am developing against Bedrock)

**CURRENT STATUS: Grid Layout Exportable and Grid Map Complete, no UI or any buildings capable**

This is basic tool the uses Minecraft Functions to create Randomized Buildings, towsn,Cities, etc.

Function files are included with Minecraft Behavior packs.  This tool will accomplish the following:

* Generates Cities and Building using functions
* Creates a self exportable Behavior pack for easy installation and distribution.
* More things but I am still getting it working

### Functions
A function file can contain up to 10,000 individual commands. Leveraging this limit, this tool will generate buildings using individual commands that are auto generated by the system.

### The Grid
* Fill commands are limited to filling in 32,768 blocks
* The largest even square that can be generated is 181x181 = 32,761
* The largest perfect "Gridable" square is  13x13 = 169x169 = 28,561
* 13x13 is referred to as **Grid Square**
* 169x169 is referred to as **Grid Container**
* There are 169 Grid Squares in One Grid Container

Using this grid setup, the system generates a start and end coordinates for both a container and all of its containing squares.
Since we have all of this information now we can use this data to populate buildings on the squares.

The above screenshot is the generation of four 169x169 Grid Containers, and each container has 169 13x13 grid squares.
This grid is drawn in 4 function commands.  In the application however, every single point within this gird can be procedurally referenced allowing for any command to be executed over it. 


### Examples
(This is just some ideas nothing is concrete at this time)
* Terraforming on a large scale
* building generation: skyscrapers, custom buildings
* Extenable: Define buildings and create custom architecture.
* Adjacency: detect adjacednt grid squares and combine space for large scale buildings.
